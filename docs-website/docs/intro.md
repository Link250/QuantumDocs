# Introduction

Hello and welcome to QuantumDocs - the place where you can find all the information about my projects and how to use them.
Currently the biggest (and only) project are the Quantum Particles, which is a custom GPU Particle System for Unity, specialized for usage on VRChat Avatars.

Before you start, make sure to be familiar with basics in Unity and VRChat Custom Avatar creation as it is required and expected for a smooth setup, for more information and some basics you can [get started here](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/).

This Documentation will constantly evolve as new updates and features get added, if you have feedback or questions feel free to let me know on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Va5VPev).
