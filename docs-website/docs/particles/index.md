# Quantum Particles

The Quantum Particles are a custom GPU Particle System for Unity, specialized for usage on VRChat Avatars.
Both the free and early access versions are available on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Va5VPev).

While Quantum Particles are designed for VRChat Avatars, they can be used in any Unity project, but due to VRChat limitations and requirements, they use a setup which would be considered less optimal for other projects.
A more Optimized version for VRChat Worlds is planned, but nothing outside of VRChat is planned at the moment.

:::warning
Quantum Particles only work on PC Avatars/Worlds! Quest and Android/iOS are not supported.
