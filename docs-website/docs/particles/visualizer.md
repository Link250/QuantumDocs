# Visualizer

## Base Settings

### Input Texture
[Render Texture](./textures#render-texture) or [Shape Texture](./textures#shape-texture) containing the particle input data.

If this visualizer is used for simulated particles, **DO NOT** remove this texture or edit the settings, unless you know what you are doing, without it the particles might not move or show up at all.

**EXCEPTION**: if you want to change the amount of particles, follow this guide: [Change Particle Amount](./setup-avatar#change-particle-amount).

If you want to use static particles (no movement or interaction) you can also directly use a [Shape Texture](./textures#shape-texture) here, just make sure the Resolution of the Texture matches the mesh you are using for optimal results.
